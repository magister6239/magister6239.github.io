This article is based on a December 2021 episode of Skillbox‚Äôs People and Code podcast.\n‚Äî Alexander, tell us what you do and what problems you solve? ‚Äî My main place of work is the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT), also known as Phystech. In addition, I work at the Institute of Nuclear Research of the Russian Academy of Sciences and JetBrains Research - this is a community of laboratories associated with JetBrains. The company supports laboratories and thus gathers the scientific community around itself.\nI am engaged in neutrino physics, this is the main direction of my scientific activity. But in recent years I have been developing more software and libraries for scientific research.\n‚Äî How does science differ from commercial development in terms of tasks? How does this affect the choice of tools and programming languages? ‚Äî Science has always been and remains ‚Äúfaster, higher, stronger‚Äù than other spheres. Scientists often solve the same problems as in commercial development, but on a much larger scale. Let‚Äôs remember the Internet protocol HTTP: it was originally created so that scientific centers could exchange large amounts of data. In one of the corridors of CERN there is even a sign: ‚ÄúThe Internet was invented in this room.‚Äù\nIn particle acceleration experiments at the Large Hadron Collider, if memory serves, 25 GB of data are generated per minute. For commercial projects this is simply incomprehensible. We work with volumes of data that are not available anywhere else.\nData analysis and so-called Data Science have already become part of the industry. ‚ÄúSo-called‚Äù because there is still no clear definition of what kind of science this is. Nevertheless, all the methodology and new tools are developed by scientists, because only they can operate with complex mathematical models.\nAn important feature of science is that there are very few professional programmers in it. Therefore, the tools that scientists use must not only be the most flexible and fastest, but also simple. Otherwise, non-programmer scientists will create such a thing that no one will be able to figure it out later. Actually, something similar has already happened in physics, and now the scientific community is solving this problem.\nThe fact is that physicists write computational code in C++, and then wrap it in Python code. And it seems to me that this approach has outlived its usefulness: in Python it is very difficult to maintain a large code base, and here the size of projects is growing precisely on the side of the users of the code - scientists. Therefore, such systems are slowly falling apart and over the past five years, engineers and scientists have been looking for more flexible and simpler alternatives.\n‚Äî Do other sciences use the same combination of languages? ‚Äî Yes, it‚Äôs about the same everywhere, but with a slight difference. For example, bioinformatics as a separate field has emerged relatively recently. Unlike physicists who had to ‚Äúswitch‚Äù to Python, they immediately began working in modern languages. But most sciences still use C, Fortran and C++ libraries, and write a Python add-on on top of them. And now there are the same problems with flexibility.\nIn addition to Python, in various fields of science they write or have tried to write in other languages.\nR. It is used in statistics. It is a highly specialized language that is great for solving statistical problems. But often we need not only to receive data, but also to create a web service so that the user has access to this data. Writing it in R is not easy.\nJulia This is quite an interesting language with many design features. Try it if you lack speed or flexibility in Python. However, Julia also has a drawback: its set of tools is still unstable.\nJulia –ø—Ä–∏–¥—É–º–∞–ª–∏ –∫–∞–∫ –∞–ª—å—Ç–µ—Ä–Ω–∞—Ç–∏–≤—É Python –∏ MATLAB. –ü–æ—Å–ª–µ–¥–Ω–∏–π –¥–æ —Å–∏—Ö –ø–æ—Ä –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑—É—é—Ç, –Ω–æ —ç—Ç–æ –ø—Ä–æ–ø—Ä–∏–µ—Ç–∞—Ä–Ω–∞—è, ¬´–Ω–µ–∂–∏–≤–∞—è¬ª —Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º–∞. –ö–∞–∫ —Ç–æ–ª—å–∫–æ –≤—ã –≤—ã—Ö–æ–¥–∏—Ç–µ –∑–∞ —Ä–∞–º–∫–∏ –ø—Ä–∏–≤—ã—á–Ω—ã—Ö –∑–∞–¥–∞—á, —Ç–æ —Å—Ä–∞–∑—É –æ—â—É—â–∞–µ—Ç–µ –µ–≥–æ –æ–≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—á–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å.\nJulia was invented as an alternative to Python and MATLAB. The latter is still used, but it is a proprietary, ‚Äúnon-living‚Äù system. As soon as you go beyond your usual tasks, you immediately feel its limitations.\nSwift. They also tried to make Swift a universal language, but it never went beyond iOS. And then Kotlin appeared, which in syntax is very similar to Swift, but at the same time is suitable for solving a wider range of problems and allows you to work with libraries from Java, JavaScript and C.\nJava. I used to program in Java - it‚Äôs a cool language that is often unfairly criticized. It was created for the enterprise, so there is an overly drawn-out ‚Äúceremony‚Äù: to build a ‚Ä¶","date":1715040000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1715040000,"objectID":"3351191163b6d09faf644cf4547a9651","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/scintific-programing-languages/","publishdate":"2024-05-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/scintific-programing-languages/","section":"post","summary":"Alexander Nozik, physicist and programmer, head of the Nuclear Physics Methods Laboratory at JetBrains Research, deputy head of the Laboratory of Methods of Nuclear Physics Experiments and master‚Äôs program at MIPT - about how to transfer scientific code to a modern stack and why it is difficult to introduce new tools into science.","tags":null,"title":"Scientific programming languages","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"from IPython.core.display import Image Image(\u0026#39;https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png\u0026#39;) print(\u0026#34;Welcome to Academic!\u0026#34;) Welcome to Academic!

After completing the practical training, a report must be written. In it, the student describes in detail all the actions carried out during the internship at an enterprise or institution. Features of compiling a report on industrial practice and its structure\nFeatures of compiling a report on industrial practice and its structure The practical training report is presented in the amount of 21-28 sheets of format A, which the student will submit to his supervisor. This is a more difficult option than introductory practice, because here it will not be enough to describe observations and what you saw in the work process. Here the student must conduct an analysis of the organization‚Äôs economic activities and demonstrate materials where these processes will be displayed.\nThe organization of the internship is the responsibility of the educational institution, but if desired, the student himself can choose the place of internship. Before starting, all students receive specially developed plans for practical training from the educational and scientific department. If a student chooses a place of internship from the list provided by the university, then the possibility of sending the student for practical training and assigning a supervisor from the organization to him is negotiated.\nDuring the internship, the student must comply with the internal regime of the organization, work on an individual task plan, keep a practice diary and prepare a report. Within 5-7 days after the end of the practical training, the teacher must provide a report and a completed diary with the seal of the organization, as well as a reference from the supervisor.\nIf we talk about the practical training diary, then this is a special document that displays all the work done by the student in the organization. All actions of the trainee are recorded here and thus the teacher can track the activity. The report on practical training must also indicate the objectives of the course, what tasks were assigned to the student and the results of the implementation, as well as the methods that were used to complete the tasks. Preparation of a report on production practice\nPreparing a report on industrial practice According to the structure of the industrial practice report, it contains several parts. Here is a list of required sections:\n- A title page containing the student‚Äôs data, information about the place of internship and educational institution, as well as the year and city of internship. - Certificate of practical training, which is filled out on the organization‚Äôs letterhead and contains the seal and signature of the manager. - Introductory part of the report. Here the student must describe the place of internship, analyze its activities, assess the market position, show the management system, etc. Be sure to indicate the goals and objectives of the practice in this part. - The content or main part of the report has several sections with a total volume of 10-15 pages. Section 1 contains basic information about industrial practice; section 2 indicates the deadlines; section 3 presents the individual task that was assigned to the student for the period of practical training; section 4 contains all the trainee‚Äôs actions by date (the so-called practice diary); Section 5 summarizes the practice and draws relevant conclusions. - Feedback from the practice manager from the organization is the main part of the entire report. Here the head of the organization writes about how the trainee managed to prove himself. - List of used literature, documentation, regulations and applications. A description of the activities of an organization or enterprise is a mandatory part of the practice report. The topic to be studied, production problems are also indicated and ways to solve them are formed, what methods will help to conduct the research, and the theory necessary for a full study of production.\nRegarding applications, this is also an important part of the internship report, because it is from them that the teacher can clearly evaluate the work done by the student during the internship. This includes documents the trainee worked with, reports, instructions, calculations, technical maps, etc. Can be supplemented with photographs from the internship site.\nSeparately, it is worth dwelling on the list of literature used, which includes methodological and theoretical instructions, other sources that were used during the period of internship and writing the report. The list is compiled in accordance with the rules and requirements of GOST, which is a single criterion for the preparation of all scientific works. Of course, each educational institution provides its own guidelines, which must also be followed when preparing the report.

It is the process of tracking code changes, coordinating the work of multiple developers, and restoring previous versions of the project when necessary. One of the most popular version control tools is Git. In this blog, we‚Äôll look at the basics of Git and its practical aspects.\nWhat is Git? Git is a distributed version control system developed by Linus Torvalds. It allows developers to effectively manage changes to the code, create separate development branches, merge them, and track the history of project changes.\nBasic principles of Git: Repository: Git stores all project data in a special repository called a repository. The repository contains the entire history of changes to the project, including files, commits and branches.\nCommits: Commits are snapshots of the state of a project at a specific point in time. Each commit contains information about the changes made and the author.\nBranching: Branching allows you to create separate development branches in which you can make changes independent of the main branch (usually the master branch). This helps isolate new features or fixes from the main project code.\nMerging: Once work on new functionality or bug fixes is completed, changes from a separate branch can be merged into the main branch through a process called merging. This allows you to integrate changes from different branches into the main project code.\nRollback: Git allows you to return to previous states of a project if you need to undo changes or restore previous versions.\nBenefits of using Git: Ease of collaboration on a project for the development team. Git provides mechanisms for collaborative code editing, change tracking, and conflict resolution.\nTracks the history of changes, making it easier to find and fix errors. With Git, developers can easily go back to previous versions of code and examine the change history to find the root cause of problems.\nThe ability to experiment with new features without damaging the main code. Git allows you to create separate branches to develop new features or experimental changes, which can be integrated into the main project code after successful testing.\nQuick restoration of previous versions of the project. If necessary, developers can easily revert to previous versions of a project using Git, ensuring a secure and reliable development process.\nConclusion Git is a powerful version control tool that greatly simplifies the software development process. Understanding its key principles and basic commands allows developers to effectively version control their projects and make them more reliable and stable. It‚Äôs important to note that using Git requires practice and experience, but its basic principles are easy to understand and use in everyday development.\nBest wishes, Alexander üôå ","date":1680134400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1680134400,"objectID":"b51c39c0ac0ec5a38bb139cda30bb055","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/git/","publishdate":"2023-03-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/git/","section":"post","summary":"Version control is an integral part of software development.

You can customize the styles under the syntax_highlighter option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() ``` renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() Mindmaps Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for mindmaps.\nSimply insert a Markdown markmap code block and optionally set the height of the mindmap as shown in the example below.\nA simple mindmap defined as a Markdown list:\n```markmap {height=\u0026#34;200px\u0026#34;} - Hugo Modules - wowchemy - blox-plugins-netlify - blox-plugins-netlify-cms - blox-plugins-reveal ``` renders as\n- Hugo Modules - wowchemy - blox-plugins-netlify - blox-plugins-netlify-cms - blox-plugins-reveal A more advanced mindmap with formatting, code blocks, and math:\n```markmap - Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://docs.hugoblox.com/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/HugoBlox/hugo-blox-builder) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ ``` renders as\n- Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://docs.hugoblox.com/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/HugoBlox/hugo-blox-builder) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ Charts Wowchemy supports the popular Plotly format for interactive charts.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example line-chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026#34;line-chart\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\nYou might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$...${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} or {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$$...$${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}}, respectively. (We wrap the LaTeX math in the Wowchemy math shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown. The math shortcode is new in v5.5-dev.)\nExample math block:\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$ \\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2} $$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$ Example inline math {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the math linebreak (\\\\):\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$ f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases} $$ Diagrams Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid graph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] ``` renders as\ngraph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid sequenceDiagram Alice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts!

Software architecture is the foundation of IT product development. Developers write code to create a program. Strings are combined into functions, functions are combined into classes, classes are combined into modules. The result is a finished program.\nTo reduce the time required to create a complex product, developers at the beginning of work create a general plan for the future software with the main blocks and ways to connect them. Then they detail it, working out the requirements and characteristics. This is how information is obtained to build software components.\nFirst, due to manageability, the architect uses individual components and modules responsible for individual functions to organize software development and support.\nAlso, the clear architecture of the software product makes it easy to support. Even if developers are not familiar with the details of the system, they will be able to quickly and easily navigate the code, making the team‚Äôs work easier.\nWith the help of software architecture, you can easily modify, expand and scale the project. Quickly add new elements, increase functionality and productivity, and use resources efficiently.\nSoftware architecture, including monolithic architecture, allows for reuse. Components are used multiple times in different parts of the system. The main benefit is to reduce the number of errors and reduce development time. It also includes safety measures to ensure protection.\nBasic principles of software architecture\nPrinciples that are taken into account during design. Flexibility. Build not for years, but with the possibility of making changes. Consider how the program may change to meet modern needs, and add flexibility to easily support changes. Openness/closedness. Software entities are closed for modification and open for expansion. Risk reduction and analysis model. It is important to use tools such as UML to capture requirements and design decisions. You should not formalize the model in such a way that it is impossible to easily adapt and repeat the design. Stability - organizing dependencies from more stable components to less stable ones. Uniqueness - avoiding code duplication. Minimal knowledge. Each module knows only about its neighbors to reduce interdependence and increase isolation. Sharing of responsibilities. 1 element - 1 reason for change (for a clear division of responsibilities). By following these architectural principles, you can design a system that is extensible, flexible, and maintainable.\nTypes of architectural styles Architectural styles are high-level strategies. They represent an abstract structure for systems.\n8 main styles:\nMulti-layered. Component-oriented. Service-oriented. Distributed system. Subject-oriented. ‚ÄúTranslator‚Äù. Parallelism. Data-driven. Multilayer is the most common. A typical example is a layered style with 3 layers: presentation layer, business logic and data storage. Pros: easy to understand, test and support. The downside is the appearance of performance overhead.\nComponent-oriented separates functionality into layers within a single system, organized as reusable and loosely coupled components. Advantages: Flexibility, Maintainability, Reusability. Disadvantage: the components are difficult to manage.\nService-oriented for developing software as a set of interacting services over a network. Pros: Loose coupling, flexibility, and reusability. Disadvantages: complexity, network dependence.\nDistributed system. Components on networked computers pass messages to communicate and coordinate actions to achieve a goal. Advantages: general access, resistance to errors and failures, scalability. Disadvantages: complexity, network dependence.\nDomain-oriented - creation of software abstractions (domain models). It is characterized by limited connections, integrity and interconnection. Disadvantage: Requires deep understanding and experience.\nThe ‚Äútranslator‚Äù determines how sentences are evaluated. For each symbol, a terminal or non-terminal style is created. It is highly flexible and easy to debug. Disadvantage: Requires more resources.\nIn the parallelism style, multiple independent tasks are executed at the same time. Parallelism improves performance, which is especially important for multiprocessor systems. The downside is the complex mutual blocking.\nData-centric architecture. The style focuses on organizing and transforming data. Suitable for large volumes of data and solving complex problems. Ensures correct data sequencing, integrity and reliability. Disadvantages include possible scalability issues.\nArchitectural Patterns These are subject-specific and specific elements for a particular module or problem. A structured solution that describes the organization of components and interactions. Patterns are similar to software design patterns, but more abstract.\nEach architectural style has its own patterns. Multilayer has a multi-layer pattern and ‚ÄúClean Architecture‚Äù.
